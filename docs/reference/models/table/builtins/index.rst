A growing collection of :class:`~aiosnow.models.table.TableModel` classes is included with the library, with schemas defined
from ServiceNow table definition *defaults*.

These classes are typically subclassed and adjusted to reflect the ServiceNow instance at hand, but can be used directly as well.
