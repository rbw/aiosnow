Models
======

To perform API operations, an API model object must be created, either via the :class:`~aiosnow.Client` factory
method or by importing and instantiating the model class directly.

Concrete models, such as those of :class:`~aiosnow.models.TableModel` type, are modelled after ServiceNow API resources.
