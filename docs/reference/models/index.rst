Models
======

To perform API operations, an API model object must be created, either by using a :class:`~snow.Snow` factory
method or by importing and instantiating the model class directly.

Concrete models, such as those of :class:`~snow.models.table.TableModel` type, are modelled after a ServiceNow API resource.
