Schema
======

Schemas are used for describing API models using :ref:`fields <fields-root>` and the :class:`~aiosnow.model.schema.BaseSchema.Meta`
inner class for type-specific configuration, such as `table_name` in the :class:`~aiosnow.models.table.TableSchema` class.

Check out the :ref:`built-in schemas <schemas-root>` if you're looking to get started quickly.
