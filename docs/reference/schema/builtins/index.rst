Builtins
========

At some point you probably want to roll your *own* schemas, however, if you're looking to get started quickly,
the built-in `aiosnow.schemas` package is the speedy route.

If you have created a schema that you think should be included in **aiosnow**, Create a PR at: `github.com/rbw/aiosnow/pulls <https://github.com/rbw/aiosnow/pulls>`_.
