Schemas
=======

At some point you probably want to roll your own schemas, however, if you're looking to get started quickly,
the built-in `snow.schemas` package is the speedy route. It contains :class:`~snow.resource.schema.Schema`
type classes modelled after the ServiceNow table defaults, and can be used either directly or tailored to your needs.

More Schemas will be added on an ongoing basis.
